# benchmark-scripts
Scripts for pocketpy benchmark. Executables are automaticly generated by github actions. 
The executables are generated through dynamic compilation, including all release versions and the current main branch. 

## Issues
- github workflow is needed to upload artifacts


## Build

```
python build_all_versions.py
```

## Run benchmarks

```
python scripts/run_benchmarks.py
```

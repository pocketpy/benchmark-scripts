# benchmark-scripts
Scripts for pocketpy benchmark. Executables are automaticly generated by github actions. 
The executables are generated through static compilation, including all release versions and the current main branch. 

## Issues
- version below v2.0.0(including 2.0.0) can't be generated properly using -DPK_BUILD_STATIC_MAIN
- version below v1.0.5(including 1.0.5) doesn't have a CMakeLists.txt, assert prebuild.py will fail
- github workflow is needed to upload artifacts
